Description: 
HTML/Javascript game, made using W3 schools game tutorial 
http://www.w3schools.com/graphics/game_canvas.asp as a learning guide.
The aim of the project was to increase my understanding of Javascript. The aim of the game is 
to evade all the zombies by jumping over them. Level completion occurs after you have evaded 
100 zombies.
