Description: 
HTML/Javascript game, made using W3 schools game tutorial as a learning guide. 
http://www.w3schools.com/graphics/game_canvas.asp 

The aim of the game is to evade all the zombies by jumping over them. Level completion occurs after you have evaded 
100 zombies.

I am looking for new contributors to this project as it is only the basic structure of the game and needs a lot
more features added. Please read the contributing guide if you would like to contribute.
